# Concise Ranked Functional Enrichment (CRFE) User Manual
Welcome to CRFE! This user manual provides a comprehensive guide to using the software effectively.

CRFE provides a high-level interpretation of high-throughput gene expression data. For this type of analysis, the user possesses a ranked list of genes, ranked f.e. by differential expression between treatment and control samples. The genes above a certain threshold are considered differentially expressed or perturbed, all other genes form the background or the unperturbed genes. Given categories that describe the biological functions of different sets of genes (e.g., biological process terms and annotations from the Gene Ontology), we can ask the question of which functional categories best explain the observed gene list. A good collection of functional categories explains as many as possible perturbed genes, and as few as possible unperturbed genes. In particular, particularly many highly perturbed genes should be explained and the collection should consist of only a small number of specific categories. CRFE returns a list of functional categories that satisfies all these requirements. Investigating this list is a good first step to interpreting the results of any high-throughput gene expression experiment. CRFE can also be used in other omics functional enrichment analyses, including genome, epigenome, proteome, and metabolome.

## Download / Installation
A working Python distribution and the program `crfe.py` are required to use CRFE. The program has been developed and tested extensively under Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 but should work for Python 2.6+. It requires the packages, `sys`, `math`, `random`, `os`, `datetime`, `csv`, `cPickle` (Python 2.x) / `pickle` (Python 3), `optparse`. The correct setup can be tested by executing the example below and comparing the output to the provided output.

## Using CRFE
CRFE accepts different types of command line options. See the [table](#complete-option-list) below or type `crfe.py -h` for details about all available command line options.

A typical invocation of CRFE will look like this:
```
python crfe.py -a <annotations file> -g <gene file>
```

We recommend using CRFE with user-defined parameters based on the data. Specifically, users should set the following parameters:

- `-T THRESHOLD_TYPE` and `-t THRESHOLD`: These parameters should be adjusted to match the input gene list.
- `-b BELIEF`: This parameter determines the emphasis placed on the top-ranked genes.
- `-n REPEATS`: This parameter specifies the number of repeated CRFE runs.

By customizing these parameters according to the specific data being analyzed, users can optimize the performance of CRFE for their particular use case.

## Example
To test CRFE on your local machine, please download the annotation file `GOhuman_ft_named.txt` and the sample data `GSE87340_tumor_normal_log2fc-overexp.txt` from the **data** folder.

To run GSEA with the default settings, use the following command line: 
```
python crfe.py -a 'GOhuman_propagate_combined.txt' -g 'GSE87340_tumor_normal_log2fc-overexp.txt'
```
Once executed, CRFE will create a **saved_data** directory where it will store information about the annotation file and the input gene list. The result text file generated by CRFE will be saved in the **output** directory.

## Result
The result consists of two parts: The first part records all the parameters for the current run. The second part is a table that presents a ranked set of functional categories (rows) and their corresponding statistics (columns).

| Statistic      | Description                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Order    | The rank of the functional category based on their Mean Posterior Probability|
| #(Annotations)     | The size of the category, indicating the number of elements (genes) annotated to it|
| #(Annotations of perturbed genes)    | The count of perturbed elements (genes) annotated to the category|
| Mean Posterior Probability     | The average posterior probability calculated from all repeats|
|Standard Deviation Posterior Probability  | The standard deviation of posterior probability from all repeats|
|p-value|The p-value obtained from the Hypergeometric test|
|Average Expression Level| The average expression level (second column in the gene list) of elements (genes) in this category|
|Average position perturbed genes| The average position of elements (genes) within the full gene list of the category|
|Term Name|Identifier or name of the category|

                        If threshold_type==proportion, this describes the
                        proportion of genes considered perturbed, otherwise it
                        describes the threshold in the expression values to be
                        used (default 0.3)

                        chooses the false poositive and negative rates such
