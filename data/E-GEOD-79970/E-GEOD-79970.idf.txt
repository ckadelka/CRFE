Public Release Date	2016-04-08
Experiment Description	Aim: To discovery biomarkers in JIA base on gene expression from RNA sequencing on PBMC Method: Paired-end Ilumina sequencing to capture gene expression of PBMC from JIA individuals and healthy controls Results:sample heterogeneity makes RNA sequencing on PBMC unsuitable as a first-step method for screening biomarker candidates in JIA RNA sequencing on PBMC of 3 independent cohorts consist of JIA patients and healthy controls							
Investigation Title	Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) Gene Expression-Based Biomarkers in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)
Protocol Name	P-GSE79970-2	P-GSE79970-1
Protocol Description	Sequences were excluded for adapter contamination and low quality bases Sequences were aligned to hg19 human reference genome using Tophat version 2.0.13 Gene expression abundance was calculated by HTSeq count version 0.6.0 Genome_build: hg19 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: tab-delimited text files include gene count values for each sample	Total RNA was extracted using TRIzolâ„¢ reagent according to manufacturer's directions. RNA was further purified using RNeasy MiniElute Cleanup kit including a DNase digest according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically (Nanodrop, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and assessed for quality by capillary gel electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) Samples libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit according to the manufacture's recommended protocols
