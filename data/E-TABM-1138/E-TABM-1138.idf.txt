Publication Title	Pharmacogenomics of bortezomib test-dosing identifies hyperexpression of proteasome genes, especially PSMD4, as novel high-risk feature in myeloma treated with Total Therapy 3.			
Experiment Description	High PSMD4 expression levels in plasma cells are linked to poor prognosis in multiple myeloma. Additional file available-E-TABM-1138.additional.zip			
Protocol Name	P-TABM-5855	P-TABM-5856	P-TABM-5857	P-TABM-5858
Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Quiagen, Valencia, Ca).	cDNA was prepared and biotinylated using the Affymetrix GeneChip HT 3 IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). 	Samples were hybridized to an Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 microarray according to the manufacturer's recommendations and then read on a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500. Gene expression levels are log2 transformed.
