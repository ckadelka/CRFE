Comment[Submitted Name]	Core Ileal Transcriptome in Pediatric Crohn Disease			
Public Release Date	2014-07-24			
Experiment Description	We report the global pattern of ileal gene expression in a cohort of 359 treatment-na√Øve pediatric Crohn Disease, Ulcerative Colitis patients and controls. We focus on genes with consistent altered expression in inflamed and unaffected ileum of CD [ileal-involved CD (iCD) and non-invloved ileal CD (cCD)], but not in the ileum of ulcerative colitis or control. Ileal biopsies were obtained during diagnostic colonoscopies of children and adolescents aged less than 17 years, who presented with IBD-like symptoms. All patients underwent baseline colonoscopy and histological characterization; non-IBD controls were those with suspected IBD, but with no microscopic or macroscopic inflammation and normal radiographic, endoscopic, and histologic findings. Biopsies were stored at -80 degrees.

Protocol Name	P-GSE57945-3	P-GSE57945-1	P-GSE57945-2	
Protocol Description	Illumina HiSeq 2000 for sequencing. Reads were aligned using TopHat, using hg19 as the reference genome and mapping reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) as output. RPKM were normalized using the DESeq algorithm using Avaids NGS software, where normalized counts were log2-transformed and base-lined to the median expression of control samples. Normalized expression values were baselined to the median of all samples. We removed all transcripts that did not have at least 5 RPKM in at least 5 different samples. Genome_build: GRCh37 (hg19) Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Tab-delimited text files contain normalized and baselined RPKM values for each sample.	Ileal biopsies were stored in RNAlater at -80C.	RNA was isolated using the Qiagen AllPrep RNA/DNA Mini Kit, RNA quality and concentration were measured by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA preparation kit and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 with single-end 50-bp reads (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
