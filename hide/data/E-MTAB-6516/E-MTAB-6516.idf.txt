Experiment Description	Background & Aims Patient-derived gastrointestinal organoids are powerful tools for studying human physiology and disease. However, generating organoids requires prompt isolation and culture of fresh tissue, which is labor and time intensive, placing restraints on basic and clinical research. For example organoid biobanking efforts, or the ability to obtain specimens from distant locations that lack the expertise to culture organoids, is limited by current approaches. We sought to develop a method by which tissue biopsies from patients could be cryo-preserved, stored, or shipped, and later thawed in order to establish live organoid cultures. Methods A method for freezing and recovery, along with straightforward isolation methods using readily available materials were developed. Epithelial isolation and culture conditions were optimized to promote cell survival and the establishment of long-term culture post-thawing. Results Patient biopsies from stomach, duodenum, ileum, colon and from adenomateous colonic polyps  were frozen, subsequently thawed and used to successfully establish patient-specific epithelium-only organoid cultures with 100% efficiency (n=31 independent patient biopsies from different regions of the GI tract). Frozen tissue could be shipped internationally and across the United States and used to establish successful organoid cultures.  Organoid cultures could be expanded, passaged and frozen down for long-term storage. RNA-sequencing demonstrates that organoids derived from fresh tissue or from frozen biopsies are >99% transcriptionally identical. Conclusions Cryo-preservation of human tissue biopsies followed by the establishment of long-term, expandable cultures has negligible effect on transcription when compared to freshly prepared organoids, and will be of immense benefit to research and for clinical applications. This technique will allow for the establishment of biobanks of human tissues that can be revived and cultured in the future as well as transported across the globe for research, therapeutic or diagnostic use in remote labs and/or clinics.

Protocol Description	Whole isolated crypts were embedded in 50uL Matrigel droplets in wells of a 24-well plate with growth media changed every 48 hours. LWRN Growth Media was produced as previously described (Miyoshi and Stappenbeck 2013). Conditioned media from L-WRN cells containing Wnt3a, Rspondin3, and Noggin, is mixed 1:1 with a 2x basal media comprised of: Advanced DMEM/F12 – 214mL, Glutamax (100x, 200mM) – 5mL, HEPES (100x, 1M) – 5mL, N2 Supplement (100x) – 5mL, B27 Supplement (50x) – 10mL, Pen/Strep (100x) – 5mL, N-acetylcystine (500 mM) – 1mL, Nicotinamide (1M) – 5mL.	Frozen samples were derived from enteroids grown from cryporeserved human gastrointestinal biopsies. Fresh samples were derived of biopsy portions that were never frozen.	Samples were sequenced over 10 full lanes, 50bp single ended reads on a HiSeq 2500	Enteroids were isolated from Matrigel droplets and manually sorted to remove dead or unhealthy entroids. Multiple healthy whole enteroids were pooled for each sample.	RNA was isolated using either standard MagMAX or Qiagen RNeasy micro kits.	Libraries were created with Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kits.
