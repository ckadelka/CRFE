Experiment Description	As part of current harm reduction strategies, candidate modified risk tobacco products (MRTP)s are developed to offer adult smokers who want to continue using tobacco products as an alternative to cigarettes while potentially reducing individual risk and population harm compared to smoking cigarettes. One of these candidate MRTPs is the Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2 which does not burn tobacco, but instead heats it, thus producing significantly reduced levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC)s compared with combustible cigarettes (CC). The assessment of MRTPs against combustible cigarettes requires the establishment of exposure-response markers. Biomarkers derived from blood offer for the general population a less invasive alternative than sampling the primary site, such as the airways. Various diseases and exposures, including cigarette smoke, have been shown to alter the molecular profile of the blood. Leveraging this fact, a whole blood derived gene signature that can distinguish current smokers from either non-smokers or former smokers with high specificity and sensitivity was previously reported. Four controlled, parallel randomized groups, open-label clinical studies were conducted with subjects randomized to three groups: (1) switching from CCs to THS2.2 (or its mentholated version, respectively); (2) continuous use of CC; or (3) smoking abstinence. These studies had an investigational period of five days in confinement which was followed by an 85 day ambulatory period for two of them. By measuring biomarkers of exposure to selected HPHCs, these studies showed a consistent reduced exposure in subjects that either stopped smoking or switched to THS2.2 (including mentholated version), compared with subjects who continued smoking their own cigarettes at both day 5 and at day 90. To complement the classical exposure measurements, we tested the small signature consisting of only 11 genes on the blood transcriptome of subjects enrolled in the clinical studies. We show that in all four clinical studies tested, the signature scores were consistently reduced in subjects that either stopped smoking or switched to THS2.2 compared with subjects who continued smoking their conventional tobacco products at both day 6 and at day 91.

Protocol Description	These randomized, open-label, parallel group reduced exposure studies included THS2.2 in its mentholated version (ad libitum use), CC (ad libitum use), and smoking abstinence (SA) arms and had two distinct periods: a five day confinement investigational exposure period to investigational product in confinement followed by an eighty-five-day ambulatory investigational exposure period	PAXGene Blood RNA tubes were collected according to manufacturer instructions. 2.5ml whole blood in 6.9ml of PAXGene RNA reagent. Keep 2 hours at room temperature then freeze at -80 degrees celsius.	Raw CEL files are background-corrected, normalized, and summarized using frozen-Robust Microarray Analysis (fRMA). Background correction and quantile normalization is used to generate microarray expression values from all arrays passing quality control checks, which is performed using the custom CDF (Chip Description File) environment HGU133Plus2_Hs_ENTREZG v16.0. Quality controls, including log-intensities, normalized-unscaled standard error (NUSE), relative log expression (RLE), median absolute value RLE (MARLE) and pseudo-images as well as raw image plots, are performed with the affyPLM package (Bioconductor). CEL files that fulfil at least one of the criteria described below dropped for further analysis. a) Pseudo-image displaying a spatial pattern covering approximately 10% of the pseudo-image. b) Median NUSE >1.05 c) |Median RLE| >0.1 d) |(MARLE-median(MARLE))|/ (1.4826 *mad(MARLE)) >1/?0.01 ; (where mad is the median absolute deviation)	AGCC Command Console software generates the .CEL files	Gene chips were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner following manufacturerâ€™s instructions.	Each fragmented cDNA sample was hybridized onto Affymetrix HG U133 plus 2.0 chip. Hybridization and washing steps were performed using an Affymetrix fluidics station and protocol FS450_0004.	Target preparation was performed with NuGen Ovation RNA Amplification System V2 + WB reagent. RNA input was 80ng.	RNA extraction was performed with PAXgene Blood miRNA Kit (50) Qiagen according to manufacturer instructions in a QIAcube robot.
