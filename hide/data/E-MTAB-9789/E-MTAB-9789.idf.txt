Investigation Title	RNA sequencing of unmanipulated and saline-injected skin in healthy old adults before and after oral vitamin D3 supplementation
Experiment Description	Vitamin D insufficiency may exacerbate non-specific inflammation observed in older adults. Here, we tested the hypothesis that an inflammatory gene signature present in old skin following saline injection (as model for non-specific needle injury) normalizes after oral vitamin D3 supplementation. To define the saline-induced signature, we compared gene expression in skin biopsies taken six hours after saline injection in old adults (≥65 years) to biopsies from unmanipulated skin. We then assessed signature expression in saline-injected skin of old and young adults (<40 years), and in paired samples of old adults before and after oral vitamin D3 supplementation (6400 IU/day for 14 weeks), where median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased from 43 nmol/L (interquartile range 36-53 nmol/L) to 131 nmol/L (interquartile range 115-147 nmol/L).  This submission comprises 112 samples from 57 individuals.

Protocol Description	3 mm punch skin biopsies were taken and collected into RNAlater (Qiagen) for RNA extraction.	Frozen tissue was homogenized using a Precellys Evolution homogenizer (Bertin Instruments), and total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was subjected to DNase treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA using a TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, Life Technologies). 	cDNA libraries were generated using the Kapa mRNA Hyperprep kit (Roche).	Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Nextseq using the Nextseq 500/550 High Output 75 cycle kit (Illumina) according to manufacturers’ instructions, giving a median of 23 million (range 2-39 million, interquartile range 22-25 million) 41bp paired end reads per sample.	RNAseq data were mapped to the reference transcriptome (Ensembl Human GRCh38 release 99) using Kallisto. Transcript-level counts were summed on gene level using tximport.
