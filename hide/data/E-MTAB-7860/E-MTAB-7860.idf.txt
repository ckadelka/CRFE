Experiment Description	Patient-derived intestinal organoids provide an excellent tool to unravel mechanisms underlying ulcerative colitis (UC). Fresh biopsies, to isolate crypts and culture organoids, were obtained from both inflamed and non-inflamed regions from eight patients with active UC (Mayo endoscopic subscore ≥2), and from eight non-IBD controls.To address the inflammatory character of ex vivo organoids, we compared the transcriptome of biopsies, crypts and organoids derived from inflamed, and non-inflamed regions and aimed to (re-)induce inflammation ex vivo.

Protocol Description	RNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq400.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturer instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was quantified by Nanodrop and the integrity was evaluated using Agilent Bio-analyzer 2100.	The library construction was performed by the Lexogen QuantSeq 3’ mRNA-Seq Library Kit FWD (Lexogen, Vienna, Austria)	Fresh biopsies from both inflamed and non-inflamed segments were obtained during endoscopy from 8 patients with active UC (endoscopic Mayo subscore of ≥2) and an accessible border of inflammation. Crypts were isolated and cultured as organoids for 4 weeks with weekly mechanical splitting. RNA was extracted from snapfrozen biopsies, isolated crypts and 1 and 4 week old organoids.
