Comment[Submitted Name]	4sUDRB-seq: measuring transcription elongation and initiation genomewide

Protocol Name	P-GSE57116-4	P-GSE57116-1	P-GSE57116-3	P-GSE57116-2
Protocol Description	All reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19, GRCh37) using the bowtie 2 aligner with default parameters (only setting â€“N 1) For each experiment we constructed a genome-wide profile of the signal per disjoint 100 bp adjacent bins. The sum of each experiment was normalized to be 106 Genome_build: hg19 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: xlsx file describe the transcription elongation velocity measured for all DRB-dependent genes.	Cells were treated with DRB for 3hr and harvested after DRB removal. Cells were also labeld with 4sU for 8 min beofre harvested.	4sU labled RNA was tagged with Biotion, and enriched with Streptavidin magnetic beads. cDNA libraries were prepared with Illumina TruSeq RNA sample preparation v2 kit according to the manufacturer's instructions but without the polyA isolation stage	HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics solution
