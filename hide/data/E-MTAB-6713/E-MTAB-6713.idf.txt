Experiment Description	Stable ETV5 knockdown SH-SY5Y were used to investigate the role of ETV5 in vitro and in vivo. Libraries for mRNA sequencing were prepared using the TruSeq stranded mRNA sample prep kit (Illumina), involving polyA-selection, fragmentation, adapter ligation, reverse transcription and PCR amplification. Libraries were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer prior to sequencing with read length of 75 bp on a NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina). On average 24.7 M high-quality reads were generated per sample, with a minimal read count of 20.0 M reads for sample 2015_027_009 (sample L105). For each sample, gene-level read counts and KPKM-values were generated with Sailfish (Patro et al. 2014). Read counts are the number of reads overlapping a given feature such as a gene. KPKM-values (K-mers Per Kilobase of exon per Million reads) represent read counts normalized for sequencing depth and transcript length. KPKM-values allow you to compare genes across and within samples.

Protocol Description	Paired-end sequencing was performed with read length of 75 bp on a NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina). On average 24.7 M high-quality reads were generated per sample, with a minimal read count of 20.0 M reads per sample.	Libraries for mRNA sequencing were prepared using the TruSeq stranded mRNA sample prep kit (Illumina), involving polyA-selection, fragmentation, adapter ligation, reverse transcription and PCR amplification. Libraries were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer.	Total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy kit (217004, Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions, including on-column DNase treatment. RNA concentration was determined with Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific).	Cell line samples were washed with PBS, whereafter they were scraped on ice in PBS. The samples were then centrifuged at 200g for 5 min and supernatans discarted. The remaining cell pellet was dissolved in 700 µl of Trizol and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at -80°C.Tumor samples were dissociated in the Tissuelyser with 700 µl of Trizol was added and samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at -80°C.	ETV5 mission shRNAs were obtained from the TRC1 library (Sigma-Aldrich, TRCN0000013938-42). The ETV5 mission lentiviral shRNA TRCN0000013938 (referred to as shETV5) was used throughout this manuscript as optimal shRNA (target sequence: CCGGCCGTGACACTTAGTACATTAACTCGAGTTAATGTACTAAGTGTCACGGTTTTT). Lentiviral particle production was done by seeding 3x106 HEK-293TN cells in a 10-cm dish 24h prior to transfection. The transfection of the HEK-293TN was subsequently done with trans-lentiviral packaging mix and lentiviral transfection vector DNA according to the Thermo Scientific Trans-Lentiviral Packaging Kit (TLP5913). 16h after transfection cells were refreshed with reduced serum medium and lentivirus-containing medium was harvested 48h later. Virus was concentrated by adding 2.5 ml ice-cold PEG-IT (LV810A-1, System Biosciences) to 10 ml of the harvested viral supernatants. This mixture was then incubated overnight at 4°C and FCS and antibiotic-containing medium was added to the remaining pellet upon centrifugation. NB cells CLB-GA, SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, SK-N-SH and SK-N-AS and PDX-derived Lu-NB-2 cells were transduced with concentrated virus and refreshed 24h post-transduction with normal cell culture medium. 48h post-transduction, cells were selected using 0.5-1 µg/ml puromycin (P8833, Sigma-Aldrich). The transduction efficiency was determined by qPCR. Subsequently, cells were used for functional assay profiling. pLKO.1-puro Non-Mammalian shRNA control plasmid (SHC002, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a negative control.	The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamin and 25 mM HEPES (Life Technologies).	All animal experiments were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Eight Edition) following approval of the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Ghent University (Permit number: ECD 12/22) 22. Persons who carried out the described experiment received appropriate training in animal care and handling. The mice were allowed to acclimatize for 1 week before experimental procedure started and were randomly assigned into two groups. Stable ETV5 knockdown SH-SY5Y were used to investigate the role of ETV5 in vivo. SH-SY5Y parental or SH-SY5Y shETV5 cells were cultured as described above. Next, 6x10^6 cells were mixed with Matrigel® (354230, Corning) and subsequently injected subcutaneously in the left flank of female Crl:NU-Foxn1nu nude mice. Tumour growth was followed for 33 days and tumour volume was assessed by Caliper measurements and calculated according to the spheroid formula: V=0.5*a²*b with a the smallest superficial diameter and b the largest superficial diameter. Body weight and physical status of the animals were recorded daily until they were judged to be in discomfort by animal caretakers or maximum tumour volume was reached (2000 mm³) upon which the animal was euthanized by cervical dislocation.
