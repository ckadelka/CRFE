Protocol Description	Scanned array images were exported using Illumina GenomeStudio software. The data were processed by using the R packages lumi, limma and ComBat. The raw data was VST transformed and both cell type datasets were normalized together using the robust spline normalization method (RSN) within lumi. Batch effects were corrected using ComBat. A linear model incorporating data from 63 untreated, incubated samples and 421 untreated, non-incubated samples was used to regress out the effect of incubation on gene expression.	200 ng of total RNA from monocytes and B-cells were analyzed using the Illumina HumanHT-12v4 BeadChip gene expression array platform which was performed by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Microarray Services. Briefly, total RNA was labelled and hybridized with BeadChips at 58C overnight.	50 ml of whole blood samples were collected into anticoagulant EDTA-containing blood collection tubes from a total of 432 healthy volunteers of European ancestry.	Peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified by the Ficoll gradient method using Ficoll-paque (GE). PBMCs were washed twice with Hanks buffered saline solution (HBSS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Magnetic activating cell sorting methods (MACS) were used to separate CD14+ cells as monocytes (Miltenyi). 4x5^10 CD14+ monocytes were incubated in RPMI1640 medium with 20% fetal calf serum, 2mM L-glutamate and antibiotics (penicilin 100U/ml, streptomycin 100ug/ml) at cell density 1x10^6 cells/ml overnight at 37C, 5% CO2. Following day the cells were stimulated for 24h with Interferon-gamma at 20ng/ml (R&D Systems), or 24h or 2h with lipopolysaccaride at 20ng/ml (InvivoGen).	Minimum 5x10^5 cells for naive cells or 4x10^5 stimulated cells were resuspended in RLT buffer (Qiagen) and stored at -80 C for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from using the RNeasy mini kit following the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). Total RNA was quantified by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific). A subset of RNA was analyzed using Bioanalyzer (Agilent) for quality control purpose.	The image was acquired using Illumina iScan.	Labeling
