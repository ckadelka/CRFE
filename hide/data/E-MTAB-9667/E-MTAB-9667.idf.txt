Experiment Description	RNA-seq upon MYCN activation in the hTERT-immortalized MYCN retinal pigmented epithelial cell line (RPE1–MYCN-ER). The parental hTERT-immortalized retinal pigment epithelium (hTERT-RPE1) was used as a control as this cell line does not carry the MYCN:ER expression construct. Both cell lines were treated with tamoxifen (400nM; 4-OHT) for MYCN induction (with 4-OHT or not). Analysis was performed 24 h, 48 h and 72 h upon MYCN activation, including four biological replicates per condition.

Protocol Description	To evaluate transcriptomicchanges RPE1–MYCN-ER and parental hTERT-RPE1 cells were plated in T75 in four biological replicates and treated with or without 400 nM 4-OHT (H6278; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24h, 48 h and 72 h. Controls were supplied with the same amount of EtOH as was present in the treated cells and was always ≤0.5% of the total volume.	The parental hTERT-immortalized retinal pigment epithelium (hTERT-RPE1, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and RPE1–MYCN-ER were cultured in DMEM/F-12 HEPES, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamin and 0,01mg/ml Hygromycin B according to standard procedures. Moreover, 1 ug/ml puromycin was added to the RPE1–MYCN-ER medium composition as a selection marker for the 4-OHT inducible construct.	Sequencing was performed on a high throughput Illumina NextSeq 500 flow cell (Illumina), generating 75 bp single reads.	400 ng of RNA was used to perform an Illumina sequencing library preparation using the QuantSeq 3’ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit (Lexogen, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. During library preparation, 14 PCR cycles were used. Libraries were quantified by qPCR, according to Illumina’s protocol ‘Sequencing Library qPCR Quantification protocol guide’, version February 2011. A High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US) was used to control the library’s size distribution and quality.	Total RNA was extracted using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After RNA extraction, the concentration and quality of the total extracted RNA were checked by using the ‘Quant-it ribogreen RNA assay’ (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and the RNA 6000 Nano chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), respectively.	Cell lines were harvested, centrifuged and stored at -80°C.
