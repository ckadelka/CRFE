Experiment Description	B cells from anonymous adenoid donors were isolated and sorted for naïve B cells, which were subsequently infected with a reference EBV strain (2089_B95-8) using a defined multiplicity of infection. Infection of resting B cells with EBV induces their activation, their proliferation, and subsequent immortalization giving rise to lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) in vitro. Non-infected primary B-lymphocytes immediately after preparation (day 0) and at early time points post infection (day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 14) were collected and total RNAs were prepared. We performed time course RNA-seq experiments and assessed the expression kinetics of viral (EBV_2089) and cellular genes (Hg19) in these cells that show impressive phenotypic alterations over time.  The experiment revealed the very dynamic regulation of viral and cellular genes that could be grouped into six clusters of transcriptional regulation documenting the cellular response to viral infection and the virally induced cell reprogramming and transformation.

Protocol Description	Total RNA from sorted cells frozen in TRIZOL was prepared using chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The RNA samples were further processed using the RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction including a step with DNAse treatment.	B-lymphocytes were isolated from anonymous human donors undergoing adenectomy. Adenoids were mechanically minced and single cells were fractionated by Ficoll Hypaque gradient centrifugation. Primary naïve B cells were sorted using a FACS Aria IIIu instrument (Becton Dickinson) to obtain pure populations of naïve B-lymphocytes (CD38- and IgD+). 1x10^6 sorted cells were collected and frozen in TRIZOL immediately after sorting to serve  as the non-infected sample on day 0. The remaining cells were infected with wt EBV (2089_B95-8) with a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. At the indicated time points post infection (day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 14) cells (1x10^6) were sorted for intact, living cells which were frozen at -80°C in TRIZOL.	The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primer. PolyA enriched cDNA samples were fragmented and further used for the ligation of Illumina TruSeq sequencing adapters to the 5´ and 3 ´ends of the cDNA fragments. Barcoded cDNA samples were finally amplified by PCR reaction. Prior to sequencing the PCR amplified cDNA samples were size fractionated to obtain a range of 250-600 nt long fragments using the AMPure XP kit clean-up system from Agencourt.	The prepared libraries were quantified using a Shimadzu MultiNA Electrophoresis System for DNA/RNA analysis. The samples were paired-end sequenced with a read length of 100 bases on two flow cells of the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform.
