Protocol Name	P-GSE29272-1	P-GSE29272-3	P-GSE29272-4	P-GSE29272-2	P-GSE29272-5	
Protocol Description	Microarray data were normalized using the RMA method . ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal	standard Affymetrix protocol	Total RNA was reverse transcripted to cDNA, reverse transcripted to labelled aRNA, purified, fragmented, and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Total RNA was extracted and purified by standard Trizol method and followed with qualification check by Agilent 2100.	The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.	
Protocol Type	normalization data transformation protocol	labelling protocol	hybridization protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	array scanning protocol
