Investigation Title	Molecular Analysis of Brain Neoplasia				
Comment[Submitted Name]	Molecular Analysis of Brain Neoplasia				
Experiment Description	The study includes fresh frozen tumors representing different brain tumor types and grades that were collected, processed and analyzed in a standardized fashion to allow for large-scale cross sample analysis. The sample collection was accompanied by careful and prospective clinical data acquisition, allowing matched molecular and clinical data analyses. The aim is to integrate molecular data with clinical annotations to identify new targets for therapy.
