Experiment Description	Individuals from different populations vary considerably in their susceptibility to immune-related diseases. To understand how genetic variation and natural selection contribute to these differences, we tested for the effects of African versus European ancestry on the transcriptional response of primary macrophages to live bacterial pathogens. 12% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection, and African ancestry specifically predicts a stronger inflammatory response and reduced intracellular bacterial growth. A large proportion of these differences are under genetic control: for 569 genes, more than 75% of ancestry effects on the immune response can be explained by a single cis- or trans-acting eQTL. Finally, we show that genetic effects on the immune response are strongly enriched for recent, population-specific signatures of adaptation. Together, our results demonstrate how historical selective events continue to shape human phenotypic diversity today, including for traits that are central to coping with infection. Transcriptomic profiles of 503 infected (Listeria and Salmonella) and non-infected samples at 2hr time point.

Protocol Description	Total RNA was extracted from the non-infected and infected macrophages using the miRNeasykit (Qiagen). RNA quantity was evaluated spectrophotometrically, and the quality was assessedwith the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Only samples with no evidence for RNA degradation (RNA integrity number>8) were kept for further experiments. RNA-sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq protocol. Indexed cDNA libraries were pooled (6 libraries per pool) in equimolar amounts and were sequenced with single-end 100bp/101bp reads.	Monocyte-derived macrophages were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10:1 for Salmonella typhimurium and an MOI of 5:1 for Listeria monocytogenes. A control group of non-infected macrophages was treated the same way but with only medium without bacteria.	Blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation. Monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by positive selection with magnetic CD14 Mi-croBeads (Miltenyi Biotech). Monocytes were then cultured for 7 days in RPMI-1640 (Fisher) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (FBS premium, US origin, Wisent), L-glutamine(Fisher) and M-CSF (20ng/mL; R&D systems). Cell cultures were fed every 2 days with com-plete medium supplemented with the cytokines previously mentioned. Before infection, we checked the differentiation/activation status of the monocyte-derived macrophages by flow cytometry, using antibodies against CD1a, CD14, CD83, and HLA-DR (BD Biosciences). Only samples presenting the expected phenotype for non-activated macrophages (CD1a+, CD14+,CD83, and HLA-DRlow) were used in downstream experiments
