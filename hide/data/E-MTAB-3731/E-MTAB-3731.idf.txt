Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene Expression underlying Osteo-, Adipo-, and Chondro-Genic Lineage Commitment of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells				
Experiment Description	Chondrogenic differentiation of hMSC has been investigated by this study using different growth conditions including control (INC), TGFβ1 (T), TGFβ1 + BMP2 (TB), TGFβ1 + GDF5 (TG). For each condition triplicate time course expression measurements were performed for 10 different time points.  Osteogenic differentiation of hMSC has been investigated by this study using different growth conditions including control (MD), dexamethasone (DX), dexamethasone + BMP2 (DB), dexamethasone + VitaminD3 (DV). For each condition triplicate time course expression measurements were performed for 10 different time points.  Adipogenic differentiation of hMSC has been investigated by this study using different growth conditions including proliferation medium (PR), dexamethasone + IBMX + rosiglitazone (AD), dexamethasone (DX), dexamethasone + BMP2 (OS). For each condition triplicate time course expression measurements were performed for 10 different time points.

Protocol Description	RNA was extracted using TRIzol according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen).	RNA were reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA, and used as a template for the preparation of biotin-labeled cRNA.	Biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized to the Human Genome U133A Array (Affymetrix), after which hybridization signals were amplified using a streptavidin-biotin amplification procedure.	Total RNA samples were RMA normalized using the Bioconductor package affy and log2 transformed.	Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs), harvested from normal human bone marrow, were purchased from Lonza.
