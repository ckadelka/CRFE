Investigation Title	Identification of a Molecular Signature for Acute Lyme Disease by Human Transcriptome Profiling		
Comment[Submitted Name]	Identification of a Molecular Signature for Acute Lyme Disease by Human Transcriptome Profiling		
Experiment Description	Lyme disease is challenging to diagnose, as clinical manifestations are variable and current tools to detect nucleic acid or antibody responses from Borrelia burgdorferi infection have low sensitivity.  Here we conducted the first study of the global transcriptome of patients with Lyme disease to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers.  Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and compared to 13 healthy controls at three time points after infection.  Fifteen publicly available transcriptome datasets from patients in vivo or infection models in vitro were used to assess specificity of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).  We found that Lyme disease results in profound and sustained changes in the patient transcriptomes, with a specific signature that shares 44% DEGs with other infections.   Gene expression profile from peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) of Lyme disease patients against healthy controls was undertaken. A total of 29 Lyme disease patients were sampled at 3 time points: acute Lyme pre-treatment (V1), 3 weeks later, immediately following completion of a standard course of antibiotics (V2), and 6 months following treatment completion (V5). 13 healthy controls were also sampled at one time point. Total RNA was extracted from 10e7 PBMC, followed by mRNA purification, paired-end barcode library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq 2000.

Protocol Name	P-GSE63085-2	P-GSE63085-1	
Protocol Description	Illumina Casava1.8 software used for basecalling. Sequenced reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence, and masked for low-complexity or low-quality sequence. reads were mapped to hg19 Refseq annotation using Bowtie 2 version 2.2.2 as part of Tophat 2 Fragment Per Kilobase of exon per Megabase of library size (FPKM) were calculated using cufflinks 2 Genome_build: hg19 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: tab-delimited text files include FPKM values for each Sample	PBMCs were isolated from fresh whole blood using Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque Plus, GE Healthcre) and total RNA was extracted from 10e7 PBMCs using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). Messenger RNA was isolated with Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen) Scriptseq RNA-seq library preparation kit (Epicentre) was used to generate the RNA-seq libraries according to the manufacturer's protocol.
