Investigation Title	MRCA expression				
Comment[Submitted Name]	MRCA expression				
Experiment Description	We have created a global map of the effects of polymorphism on gene expression in 400 children from families recruited through a proband with asthma. We genotyped 408,273 SNPs and identified expression quantitative trait loci from measurements of 54,675 transcripts representing 20,599 genes in Epstein-Barr virusﾡﾧCtransformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. We executed genome-wide association scans for these traits.

Protocol Type	growth protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	normalization data transformation protocol	array scanning and feature extraction protocol	labelling protocol
Protocol Description	The transformation of the peripheral blood lymphocytes in all children in the panel was carried out by the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Previously transformed cryopreserved EBV cell lines were grown as 500-ml roller cultures. Once the log phase was reached, cells were pelleted, medium was discarded and a mixture of RLT buffer and β-mercaptoethanol was added. Pellets were vortexed to ensure thorough resuspension, after which they were frozen at -70.1oC and stored at -80.1oC.	RNA was extracted in batches using the RNeasy Maxi Kit, and quality and quantity of RNA were assessed.	RMA Express was used to normalize expression data	Affymetrix CEL analysis	Affymetrix in vitro transcription
