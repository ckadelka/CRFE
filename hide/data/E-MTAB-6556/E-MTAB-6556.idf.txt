Experiment Description	Blood (mRNA and miRNA) and skin mRNA transcriptomes were investigated across three time-points in a pilot investigation of ten severe psoriasis patients, treated with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, etanercept. We used illumina RNA-sequencing to analyse the small-RNA transcriptome in blood

Protocol Description	Before conducting EDA or differential expression analysis, we remove probes with less than one count per million (CPM) in at least nine libraries. This ensures that every probe is expressed in at least one of our nine replicates per subject (three tissue types observed at three timepoints each). This threshold follows the filtering guidelines of Robinson et al. (2010). Counts are then TMM normalised prior to modelling (Robinson & Oshlack, 2010).	sequencing of mRNA extracted from skin samples was performed at GSK Stevenage using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform	Libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation Kits. The first step involved removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), conducted using biotinylated Ribo-Zero rRNA removal beads. For RNA extracted from skin, the Ribo-Zero Gold kit was used to deplete samples of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial rRNA.	mRNA was extracted from skin biopsies using Qiagen Rneasy mini kits	Samples including lesional and non-lesional skin samples, were taken at each participant visit. Skin biopsies (6mm punch biopsies) were taken from lesional (edge of a plaque) and adjacent (minimum distance of 2cm) non-lesional skin from photoprotected sites on the lower back or upper buttock at each visit. Repeat biopsies were taken at a minimum distance of 2cm and biopsy sites were recorded.  The dose of etanercept for all included participants was: Etanercept subcutaneous administration 25mg twice weekly (administered either as 25mg twice weekly or 50mg once weekly).
