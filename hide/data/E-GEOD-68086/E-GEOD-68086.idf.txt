Comment[Submitted Name]	RNA-seq of tumor-educated platelets enables blood-based pan-cancer, multiclass and molecular pathway cancer diagnostics		
Experiment Description	We report RNA-sequencing data of 283 blood platelet samples, including 228 tumor-educated platelet (TEP) samples collected from patients with six different malignant tumors (non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, breast cancer and hepatobiliary carcinomas). In addition, we report RNA-sequencing data of blood platelets isolated from 55 healthy individuals. This dataset highlights the ability of TEP RNA-based 'liquid biopsies' in patients with several types with cancer, including the ability for pan-cancer, multiclass cancer and companion diagnostics. Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing EDTA anti-coagulant by standard centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the platelet pellet, subjected to cDNA synthesis and SMARTer amplification, fragmented by Covaris shearing, and prepared for sequencing using the Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit. Subsequently, pooled sample libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. All steps were quality-controlled using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip, DNA 7500 and DNA High Sensitivity chips measurements. For further downstream analyses, reads were quality-controlled using Trimmomatic, mapped to the human reference genome using STAR, and intron-spanning reads were summarized using HTseq. The processed data includes 285 samples (columns) and 57736 ensemble gene ids (rows). The supplementary data file (TEP_data_matrix.txt) contains the intron-spanning read counts, after data summarization by HTseq.

Protocol Name	P-GSE68086-2	P-GSE68086-1	
Protocol Description	Single-end 100 bp reads were subjected to pre-aligment 5'-end quality trimming and sequence adapter clipping using Trimmomatic. Cleaned-up reads were mapped to the hg19 reference genome using STAR (version 2.3.0), using splice aware alignments and allowing for 10 mismatches. Selection of intron-spanning reads was performed using Picard-tools (version 1.115) Read summarization was performed using HTSeq (version 0.6.1) using union-mode, unstranded reads and minimal mapping quality of 35, all guided by the Ensembl gene annotation version 75. Genome_build: hg19 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Samples in the tab-delimited text file were processed according to the described protocol and data of all samples was merged in a comprehensive read count matrix.	Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing the EDTA anti-coagulant. The cells and aggregates were removed by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 120g, resulting in platelet-rich plasma. The platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 360g. The platelet pellet was collected in 30 Î¼l RNAlater (Life Technologies), incubated overnight at 4Â°C and frozen at -80Â°C for further use. Frozen platelets were thawed on ice and total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturersâ protocol. Complementary purification of small RNAs was included in the isolation procedure by addition of miRNA homogenate (Life Technologies). Total RNA was dissolved in 30 Î¼l Elution Buffer (Life Technologies) and RNA quality and quantity was measured using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip (Agilent). 100-500 pg of platelet total RNA (Bioanalyzer RIN values >7 and/or distinctive rRNA curves) diluted in nuclease free H2O was subjected to cDNA synthesis and amplification using the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit for Illumina Sequencing v1 (Clontech, cat. nr. 634936) according to the manufacturersâ protocol. Conversion and efficient amplification of cDNA was quality-controlled using the Bioanalyzer 2100 with DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent). Samples with detectable fragments in the 300-7500 bp region were selected for further processing and Covaris shearing by sonication (Covaris Inc). Sample preparation for Illumina sequencing was performed using the Truseq DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, cat nr. FC-121-2001) or Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, cat nr. FC-121-4001). Sample quality and quantity was measured using the DNA 7500 chip or DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent). High-quality samples with product sizes between 300-500 bp were pooled in equimolar concentrations (8-12 samples per Hiseq lane) and submitted for 100 bp Single Read sequencing on the Hiseq 2500 platform (Illumina).
