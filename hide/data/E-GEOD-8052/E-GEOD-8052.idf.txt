We found multiple markers on chromosome 17q21 to be strongly and reproducibly associated with childhood onset asthma in family and case-referent panels with a combined P < 10-12.  In independent replication studies the 17q21 locus showed strong association with diagnosis of childhood asthma in 2,320 subjects from a cohort of German children (P = 0.0003) and in 3,301 subjects from the British 1958 Birth Cohort (P = 0.0005). We systematically evaluated the relationships between markers of the 17q21 locus and transcript levels of genes in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from children in the asthma family panel used in our association study. The SNPs associated with childhood asthma were consistently and strongly associated (P <10-22) in cis with transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encode transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results indicate that genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression are determinants of susceptibility to childhood asthma.  Experiment Overall Design: Gene expression levels were evaluated in 404 children. We then evaluated the relationship between SNPs in the 17q21 region (which show association to asthma in the same children) with gene expression levels.

Once log phase had been obtained, cells were pelleted, media discarded and a mixture of RLT buffer and Î²-mercaptoethanol added.  Pellets were vortexed to ensure thorough re-suspension after which they were frozen at -70oC and kept at -80oC."	RNA was extracted in using the RNeasy Maxi Kit.
