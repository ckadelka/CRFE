Experiment Description	Evaluation of modulation of the innate immune response during H1N1 infection. The modulatory effect of Single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssON) on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) are evaluated. RNAseq data are used to study the effect on the transcriptome of MoDCs, during infection with simultaneous addition of ssON. Further mechanistic information are added via RNAseq data on poly I:C stimulated MoDCs (Toll-Like Receptor 3 agonist). Control samples are included to perform differential expression analysis.  Provided are the fastq files, obtained in the following manner: The RNA sequencing was performed with the TruSeq RiboZero kit from Illumina, 25 M reads per sample and 2x125bp. Read quality were assessed using FastQC (Version 0.11.5) Trim Galore (Version 0.3.6) was used for adapter removal and quality trimming with a quality threshold of 20 on the Phred scale.   Count files was created out of the trimmed  fastq by mapping high-quality reads to Homo sapiens UCSC hg38 (GRCh38.77) reference genome using STAR aligner (version 2.5) with default values and the parameter out Reads Unmapped set to Fastx in order to extract the unmapped reads. After STAR alignment, the count data for the aligned reads were generated with HTSeq-count (version 0.6.1). The-m parameter was set to union.

Protocol Description	MoDC culture Monocytes were isolated from buffy coats using Ficoll centrifugation (Lymphoprep; Axis Shield) after negative selection using the RosetteSep Monocyte Enrichment Kit (StemCell Technologies). Monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) were obtained after six days of differentiation in complete RPMI medium (RPMI 1640, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, Hyclone GE Healthcare, and 10% FBS, Sigma) complemented with GM-CSF (250ng/mL; PeproTech) and rIL-4 (6.5ng/mL; R&amp;D Systems). Cells were seeded at a density of 5x10 5 cells/mL and after three days of differentiation, 50% of the medium was replaced and new cytokines added. Staining for flow cytometry was done before and at indicated time points post viral infection.   IAV infection and treatments Stock of pandemic H1N1 virus strain A/Cal07/2009 was kindly provided by Bertin-Pharma, France. MoDC were mock-exposed or exposed to IAV or heat inactivated IAV (HI IAV,30min at 56°C) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02, 0.2 or 2 for 4h at 37°C 5%CO 2 in serum-free RPMI medium, washed in pre-warmed complete RPMI medium and distributed in 24 wells plates (0.5x10 6 /mL). Cells were then treated or not with the following molecules: synthetic, endotoxin-free, completely phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides named ssON (0.5µM; Integrated DNA Technologies), high molecular weight PolyI:C (25µg/mL; Invivogen) or the combination of both, referred as ssON/PolyI:C. The sequence of ssON is: 5’-GAAGTTTTGAGGTTTTGAAGTTGTTGGTGGTGGTG-3’.	The data provided are raw counts	25 M reads per sample and 2x125bp	Fastq files were obtained from NGI and the read quality were assessed using FastQC (Version 0.11.5) Trim Galore (Version 0.3.6) was used for adapter removal and quality trimming with a quality threshold of 20 on the Phred scale. Obtained high-quality reads were mapped to Homo sapiens UCSC hg38(GRCh38.77) reference genome using STAR aligner (version 2.5) with default values and the parameter out Reads Unmapped set to Fastx in order to extract the unmapped reads. After STAR alignment, the count data for the aligned reads were generated with HTSeq-count (version 0.6.1). The-m parameter was set to union.	At 24h or 48h post infection (p.i), supernatants and MoDC were harvested and kept at -80°C until RNA purification was performed. RNeasy ® Plus Mini kit (QIAGEN) was used for total cells RNA extraction while QIAamp ® Viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN) was used for viral RNA purification in supernatants, following manufacturer’ spin protocol.
