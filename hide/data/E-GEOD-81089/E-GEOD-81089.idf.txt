Experiment Description	Cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are of clinical interest as biomarkers and present valuable targets for immunotherapy. To comprehensively characterize the CTA landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we compared RNAseq data of 199 NSCLC tissues to the normal transcriptome of 142 samples from 32 different normal organs. Of 232 CTAs currently annotated in the CTdatabase, 96 were confirmed in NSCLC. To obtain an unbiased CTA profile of NSCLC, we applied stringent criteria on our RNAseq data set and defined 90 genes as CTAs, of which 55 genes were not annotated in the CTdatabase. Cluster analysis revealed that CTA expression is histology-dependent and concurrent expression is common. Immunohistochemistry confirmed tissue specific protein expression of selected genes. Furthermore, methylation was identified as a regulatory mechanism of CTA expression based on independent data from the Cancer Genome Atlas. The proposed prognostic impact of CTAs in lung cancer, was not confirmed, neither in our RNAseq-cohort nor in an independent meta-analysis of 1117 NSCLC cases. Fresh frozen tumor tissue from 199 patients diagnosed with NSCLC and surgically treated 2006-2010 at the Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden and 19 paired normal lung tissues. Clinical data were retrieved from the regional lung cancer registry. Several of the new CTAs are poorly characterized  Sample characteristics values represent; pTNM: decided by Hans Brunnstrom, pathologist in Lund Spring 2013 Stage according to pTNM: 1=1a 2=1b 3=2a 4=2b 5=3a 6=3b 7=IV Histology diagnosis spring 2013 HB: 1=squamous cell cancer 2=AC unspecified 3=Large cell/ NOS Surgery date: the date when sample arrived at Patologen UAS Age: age when surgery was performed Vital date: day of death or latest contact Dead: 0=no 1= yes Smoking history : 1=current 2=ex >1year 3=never WHO performance status: Performance status 0-4  Please note that the L608T_2122, L771T_1 data columns (in the processed data files) are associated with L608T and L771T samples, respectively.

Protocol Name	P-GSE81089-3	P-GSE81089-1	P-GSE81089-2																				
Protocol Description	Mapping of reads to GRCh37 reference genome using TopHat 2.0.8b with Bowtie 2.1.0. Default settings Abundance estiamtion (FPKM) using Cufflinks 2.1.1 with transcript annotation from Ensembl v73, Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.73.gtf Non-default settings: --max-bundle-frags 10000000 --max-bundle-length 10000000 Raw read count estimation using featureCounts 1.4.0p1 with same GTF as above, Settings: -g gene_id -t exon Genome_build: GRCh37 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Tab-separated matrices with FPKM and read counts, respectively	Freshly frozen tumor tissues were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound and stored at -80Ã‚Â°C.	Tissue was cut in sections (10 uM) using a cryostat. five sections (10 um) were cut and used for RNA extraction. The five sections were transferred to RLT buffer using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions. Samples were prepared for sequencing using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2, using polyA selection. The sequencing was performed multiplexed with five samples per lane on Illumina HiSeq2500 machines (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using the standard Illumina RNAseq protocol with a read length of 2 x 100 bases. Libraries were prepared according to Illumina TruSeq strand-specific RNA kit.
