Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression profiling of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)												
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Gene expression profile of OSCC, oral dysplasia, and normal oral tissue												
Experiment Description	OSCC is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. To identify potential biomarkers for the early detection of invasive OSCC, we compared the gene expressions of OSCC, oral dysplasia, and normal oral tissue from patients without oral cancer or preneoplastic oral lesions (controls). Results provided models of gene expression to distinguish OSCC from controls. RNA from 167 OSCC, 17 dysplasia and 45 normal oral tissues were extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix U133 2.0 Plus GeneChip arrays. The differentially expressed genes were identified using GenePlus software and the validation was done using RT-PCR, using independent internal and external datasets.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = gcRMA normalized	GeneChip arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip arrays Scanner 3000 7G in the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's Genomics Shared Resources	The cRNA was hybridized to an Affymetrix U133 2.0 Plus GeneChip arrays per Affymetrix protocols	The RNA and DNA from each specimen were simultaneously extracted using TRIzol method.	Biotin-labeled cRNA were prepared from 1.0 to 2.5 ug of total RNA using the GeneChip Expression 3'-Amplification Reagents Kit per manufacturer's protocol	We used gcRMA algorithm from Bioconductor to extract gene expression values and perform normalization. The data were analyzed using a regression-based, estimating equations approach implemented in GenePlus software. The hierarchical clustering was performed using Affymetrix GeneSpring software GX 7.3.1.
