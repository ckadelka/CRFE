Investigation Title	Gene Expression in Biopsies of Acute Rejection and Interstitial Fibrosis/Tubular Atrophy Reveals Highly Shared Mechanisms that Correlate with Worse Long-term Outcomes						
Experiment Description	Rationale: Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) is found in ~25% of 1-year biopsies post-transplant(1, 2). It correlates with decreased graft survival when histological evidence of inflammation is present¬.(3-5) Identifying the etiology of IFTA is important because longterm graft survival has not changed as expected given improved therapies and a dramatically reduced incidence of acute rejection.(6-8)    Methods: Gene expression profiles of 234 samples were obtained with matching clinical and outcome data (7 transplant centers). 81 IFTA samples were divided into subphenotypes by the degree of inflammation on histology: IFTA with acute rejection (AR), IFTA with inflammation and IFTA without inflammation. Samples with AR (n=54) and normally functioning transplants (TX; n=99) were used in comparisons.   Conclusions:  Gene expression profiling of all IFTA phenotypes were strongly enriched for cAR gene dysregulation pathways, including IFTA samples without histological evidence of inflammation. Thus, by molecular profiling we demonstrate that most IFTA samples have ongoing immune-mediated injury or chronic rejection that is more sensitively detected by gene expression profiling. We also found that the relative expression of AR-affiliated genes correlated with future graft loss in IFTA samples without inflammation. We conclude that undetected and/or undertreated immune rejection is leading to IFTA and graft failure. RNA was extracted from biopsy samples using the RNEasy kit (Qiagen), biotinylated cRNA prepared using Ambion MessageAmp Biotin II and hybridized to Affymetrix HG U133 Plus PM peg arrays (http://affymetrix.com/index.affx). Probe intensity data were log2–transformed and normalized using a custom-designed frozen Robust Multichip Average (fRMA). Low-variance and low signal probes were filtered according to industry standards, resulting in a filtered gene list with 17,564 transcripts.

Protocol Description	The Gene Titan Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit for 3' Array Plates PN 901530 (Affymetrix) is used to hybridize the fragmented aRNA to a multi peg Gene HT U133PM Array Plate. Hybridization is carried out for 16 hours at 48C in the Gene Titan MC (Multichannel) Instrument ( Affymetrix). Automatic staining and washing is carried out in the Gene Titan Instrument.	Total RNA is amplified, labeled and fragmented with GeneChip 3'IVT Plus Reagent kit PN 902416 (Affymetrix).	N/A	The peg array plate is automatically moved to the Xenon laser scanner of the Titan MC instrument and scanned at default settings recommended for the peg array.	RNA Extraction from PAXgene Blood Tubes: Total RNA including small and miRNA is extracted with the PreAnalytiX PAXgene Blood miRNA kit PN763134 (QIAGEN). A semi automated method using the QIAcube (QIAGEN) is used following manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and quality of the RNA is assessed on a nanodrop and Agilent Bioanalyzer.	N/A	Probes to Import: Interrogating Probes and Control Probes,  Algorithm: RMA, Background Correction: RMA Background Correction, Normalization: Quantile Normalization, Log Probes using Base: 2, Probeset Summarization: Median Polish, Probe filtering: Exclude probes with an absolute value < 4 and low variance (< 20 percentile), Median values used for probes with identical RefSeq IDs, Exclude probes without Refseq IDs (e.g. '---'). ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA normalized signals from all arrays in this study
