Experiment Description	As a result of a large number of in vitro as well as in vivo experiments with rodents, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB are now widely appreciated to play major roles in brain function. There is also a growing appreciation that decreased BDNF signalling may be a significant component in a wide range of brain dysfunction in humans based on the discovery of mutations and polymorphisms in the corresponding genes. Human neurons generated in vitro had been shown to be responsive to TrkB phosphorylation upon treatment with BNDF, TrkB agonist ZEB85, the related factor neurotrophin-4 (NT4). In order to compare the transcriptional changes upon treatment with the three TrkB ligands RNA-seq analysis was deployed. Cultures had been treated in triplicates with BDNF, ZEB85 or NT4 for 30 minutes, 2 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours, while non treated controls were lysed at each time-point.

Protocol Description	RNA-seq single-end fastq files were mapped to human assembly genome using the STAR package. Transcript counts were produced with FeatureCounts and data normalized using the Bioconductor package.	Total RNA was extracted from human neurons using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen,).	Cultures were washed with D-PBS and lysed with 350 μl of RLT RNA lysis buffer containing 1 % β-mercaptoethanol.	RNA-sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing system at a sequencing depth of 50 million 50 nucleotide single-pair end reads using the Truseq stranded mRNA guidelines (HT protocol).	The TruSeq® Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Guide and the high-throughput (HT) kit from Illumina was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	Human H9 ES cells were plated on matrigel-coated plates (Corning, VWR) and maintained in mTSER medium (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 ng/ml of FGF2 (Peprotech). hES cells were passaged by manual dissociation with 0.02% EDTA in Dulbecco’s PBS (0.5mM), pH 7.2 (Sigma) and seeded for an 8-day phase of neuronal induction in SLI medium which contained Advanced DMEM F-12 medium supplemented with glutamax, penicillin and streptomycin (ADF, Life Technologies) and 2% NeuroBrew-21 without retinoic acid (Miltenyi), the SMAD pathway inhibitors LDN193189 (1μM) and SB431542 (10μM), and the WNT pathway inhibitor IWR1 (1.5μM) (Tocris; [59]). Subsequently, neural progenitors were dissociated with Accutase (Life Technologies) and re-seeded for expansion to day 16 in LIA medium which contained ADF medium with 2% NeuroBrew-21 without retinoic acid (Miltenyi), LDN193189 (0.2μM), IWR1 (1.5μM) (Tocris) and 25 ng/ml of Activin A (Peprotech). Neuronal differentiation was initiated by seeding neural progenitors on a substrate of growth factor-reduced matrigel (Corning, VWR) & poly- L- lysine (Sigma) at a density of 100K cells/cm2 and cultured for 7 days in SynaptoJuice A medium which contained Advanced DMEM:F12 (with Glutamax), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 % NeuroBrew21 with retinoic acid (Miltenyi Biotec), 2 µM PD0332991 (Selleckchem), 10 µM DAPT (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.6 mM CaCl2 (to give 1.8 mM CaCl2 in final complete medium (Sigma-Aldrich)), and 200 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The medium was replaced at day 7 post-plating by SynaptoJuice B medium which contained equal parts Advanced DMEM/F12 (with Glutamax) and Neurobasal A (Life Technologies), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies), 2% NeuroBrew-21 with retinoic acid (Miltenyi Biotec), 2 µM PD0332991 (Selleckchem), 3 µM CHIR 99021 (Tocris Bioscience), 0.3 mM CaCl2 (1.8 mM CaCl2 final), and 200 µM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). Plated neurons were maintained for up to 14 days before exposure to TrkB ligands (see below).	H9 ES cell-derived neurons were treated for 30 min, 2 h, 12 h and 24 h with BDNF (50 ng/ml), ZEB85  (5 μg/ml) and NT4 (75 ng/ml).
